Description: A collection of data processing tools and helpers primarily motivated by forest inventory estimation. A companion packages to
        RSForTools (Remote Sensing Forestry Tools). RForInvt and RSForTools are descended from RSForInvt which is difficult to load due to many
        dependencies, many of which would not load with the RSForInvt package. RSForTools still has that problem - it can be 
        a hassle to load. The functionality here is still developmental - feel free to contribute.
